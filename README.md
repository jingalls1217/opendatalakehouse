3. [Check out **LLM Chatbot** Augmented with Enterprise Data](llm_chatbot.md)

### Use CDP Public Cloud service to ingest data, analyze, visualize and predict

This use-case aims at providing a high-level overview of how to use the CDP Public Cloud service to quickly ingest data, explore raw data, create curated versions of the data for simple reporting and dashboarding, and then run a machine learning prediction use-case. It highlights the ease of use and automation capabilities that help ensure business objectives are met.

A real-life business narrative enables you to follow and understand how one can build a pipeline based on the data lakehouse framework on CDP. This is a sample use-case and real life use-cases follow a similar pattern.

For the use-case today, we will use the airlines dataset.
